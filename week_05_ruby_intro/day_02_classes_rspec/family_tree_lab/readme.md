## Family Tree Lab

For this lab you are going to use your knowledge of Classes, inheritance and rspec to build a small family tree app and pass a bunch of tests.

## Getting started

1. Start working on the grandparent class tests and try to get them to pass one by one. To do this you will need to research how to test if something is an instance of a class. 
2. 
2. Move to the parent


- Use super to efficiently create these classes
- Use require or require relative to separate these classes into 3 files
- The Parent class should have a method to show all the children 
- The Child class should be initialized with a boolean called isBaby which is set to true
- If the child is a baby it should have a cry method which prints out "Wahhhh"
- If the child is over 2 years old it should have a talk method which tells you their name
- The child class should have a method that increments its age by one
- The child should automatically inherit the last name of the parent
- A child should have a favorite color of red, blue, purple, pink, or green
- A child should be able to tell you their favorite color
- A child should be able to learn to have a different favorite color

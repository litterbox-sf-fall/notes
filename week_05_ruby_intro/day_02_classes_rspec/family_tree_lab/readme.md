## Family Tree Lab

Create a grandparent, parent and child class. The parent should inherit from the grandparent and the child should inherit from the parent.

Write methods to calculate the number of children for the grandparent and parent as well as the number of grandchildren for the parent. 

Write tests to ensure that these calculations are correct.

Grandparents should have a name, age and gender and a method called shout which should print out "Grr" 


- Use super to efficiently create these classes
- Use require or require relative to separate these classes into 3 files
- The Parent class should have a method to show all the children 
- The Child class should be initialized with a boolean called isBaby which is set to true.
- If the child is a baby it should have a cry method which prints out "Wahhhh"
- If the child is over 2 years old it should have a talk method which 
- The child class should have a method that increments its age by one.

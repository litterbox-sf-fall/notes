Functions Lab
=============

1. Write a function that prints "Hello, World!" to the console when
   called.

2. Write a function that takes the name of a person as an argument,
   and says "Hello" to that person in the console.

3. If your previous function did not use the `return` keyword, modify
   it so that it does. It should return the message to be logged
   instead of logging it directly. Store the result in a variable and
   log that instead.

   Bonus: Appreciate the difference between logging from within the
   function and returning a value to be logged outside the function.

4.
    * Write a function add() that takes two numbers as arguments and
      returns the sum.

    * Write a function sub() take takes two numbers as arguments and
      returns the difference.

    * Write a function combine() that takes three parameters. The
      first two are numbers and the last is a boolean. If the boolean
      is true, return the sum of the first two arguments, otherwise,
      return the difference. Hint: use add() and sub() from within
      combine().

5. Write a function that prints out how many times it has been
   called.

   Hint: Can you do this using only local variables? Think about
   what we talked about regarding variable scope. Can you rely on the
   help of a global variable?

Bonus:

6. Write a function to return true or false if a number passed in is a
   prime number.

7. Write a function called merge. The function should take two sorted
   arrays of numbers as input and return a merged array of the sorted
   numbers from the input. For example, if the input arrays were var
   arr1 = [3,6,11]; var arr2 = [2,4,5,8,9]; Then the returned array
   would be: [2,3,4,5,6,8,9,11]. Avoid using any built-in sorting
   methods.

8. Write a function called letterCount that takes a string and finds
   out how many times a character occurs. For example, if the input
   was "apple", the output should inform you that "a" occurred once,
   "p" occurred twice, and "l" and "e" each occurred once. You have
   some flexibility in how you want to output this data.

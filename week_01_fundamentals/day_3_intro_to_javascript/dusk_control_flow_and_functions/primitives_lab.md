##Array Exercises

1.) Find the last name in the following array:

```
var friends = [
                'Moe', 
                'Larry', 
                'Curly',
                'Jane',
                'Emma',
                'Elizabeth',
                'Elinor',
                'Mary',
                'Darcy',
                'Grey',
                'Lydia',
                'Harriet'
              ];
```

Add your name to the end of the `friends` and add another name to beginning. Change the `Elizabeth` to `Liz`.

2.) Sort the list of `friends` above.

3.) Here are a list of `ages`

```
var ages = [83, 53, 37, 29, 60, 30, 66, 19, 59, 41, 9, 64, 19, 80, 24, 53, 70, 1, 53, 40, 92, 4, 71, 65, 8, 2, 51, 80, 94, 37, 80, 64, 19, 6, 14];

```
find the `median` age.

4.) There are a list of names in a string, below. How could we sort them? Hint: use string and array methods.
 
```
var friends = "Moe,Larry,Curly,Jane,Emma,Elizabeth,Elinor,Mary,Darcy,Grey,Lydia,Harriet";
```

5.) List all the `friends` above in reverse alphabetical order.

6.) We have two lists of friends below:

```
var myFriends = [
                  'Rickon',
                  'Meera',
                  'Hodor',
                  'Jojen',
                  'Osha',
                  'Rickard',
                  'Maester',
                  'Rodrik',
                  'Jory',
                  'Septa',
                  'Jon'
                ];

var yourFriends = [
                    'Bilbo',
                    'Boromir',
                    'Elrond',
                    'Faramir',
                    'Frodo',
                    'Gandalf',
                    'Legolas',
                    'Pippin'
                  ];
```

we need to combine them into one list and sort them.

7.) I have a list of favorite foods below. If `Popcorn` is my favorite food and `Potato chips` my second favorite, then how would you find the rank of another food. Try `Pho`.


```

var foods = [
              'Popcorn',
              'Potato chips',
              'Shrimp',
              'Chicken rice',
              'Poutine',
              'Tacos',
              'Toast',
              'French Toast',
              'Crab',
              'Pho',
              'Lasagna',
              'Brownie',

              'Donuts',
              'Ice cream',
              'Hamburger',
              'Sushi',
              'Chocolate',
              'Pizza'
            ];

```

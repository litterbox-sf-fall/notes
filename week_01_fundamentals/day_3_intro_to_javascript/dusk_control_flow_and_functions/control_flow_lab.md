# If / else

Create an array of foods. Then create an if/else statement that
prints "You have no food" if they array is empty, "You have one food"
if there is exactly 1 item in the list, and "You have lots of food"
otherwise.

# While

Use a while loop to play the
[99 bottles of beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99_Bottles_of_Beer)
game.

Have your program print the lyrics as they go from:

"99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall..."

to

"1 bottles of beer on the wall, 1 bottles of beer.
Take one down, pass it around, 0 bottles of beer on the wall..."

Make sure your loop stops at 0, or else you'll get stuck in an
infinite loop! Forever! (Hit Ctrl-c if this happens).

Bonus: Get the pluralization correct.  "1 bottle of beer" instead of
"1 bottles of beer."

# For

Create an array of some of your favorite people. Use a for loop
to say hello to each person with console.log(). For example, your
output may look like the following:

```
"Hello, Timmy!"
"Hello, Tommy!"
"Hello, Tammy!"
```

Bonus: Have the previous person say hello to the current person.

```
"Hello, Timmy!"
"Timmy says Hello, Tommy!"
"Tommy says Hello, Tammy!"
```

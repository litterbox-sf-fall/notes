# Command Line++

__OBJECTIVE__: Get stronger with command line tools. 

## Documentation

The man pages are the best place for documentation for all of these programs.  For example, ```man grep``` on your terminal will give you more information on the tool.

## Overview

Here is an overview of all the tools you will be using today.

__fg__ Bring a process from the background to the foreground

__bg__ Bring a process from the foreground to the background

__CTRL+z__ Stop a running process

__vim__ A command line file editor.  You will need to get comfortable with it when working in an ssh session.

__grep__ Searches through files and finds matches.  Can also use regular expressions to do matches.	

__top__ Displays real time system information, e.g., CPU%, Memory usage, etc.

__ps__ Lists running processes

__kill__ Kills processes

__head__ Output the top of a file to the terminal

__tail__ Output the end of a file to the terminal

## Exercises

1. Open Sublime with the following command:  ```subl &```.  What does the '&' do?  What does ```fg``` do?
2. What does ```CTRL+z``` do?  What does ```bg``` do?
3. What does ```ps``` do? Use ```kill``` to shut down Sublime.
4. Run ```top``` and check out what's going on on your computer.
5. Go to the command line and run: ```vimtutor```.  Complete lessons 1 and 2.  Feel free to do more lessons if you'd like.
6. Clone the [command line mystery repo](https://github.com/veltman/clmystery).  Read the instructions and the cheatsheet.  __DO NOT USE ANY GUI APPLICATIONS.  NO SUBLIME TEXT, NO FINDER.  ONLY TERMINAL!!__ The cheatsheet is an exception.  You can use a pdf viewer to read that if you like.

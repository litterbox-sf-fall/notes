#WDI Installfest 


We are going to install the tools necessarily to program with Ruby and Rails on your computer.

If you are unsure or run into problems during installation, don't worry; We will finish up any of the loose ends on Installfest.
	

##Verify your install
If you have already experimented with ruby or rails before, verify your versions are correct for this upcoming class.

If you can see the correct version numbers when you run the commands in Terminal below, you are good to go.

**Verify you are running 2.0+ of ruby**

`ruby -v`

**Verify you are running version 4 of Rails**

`rails -v`

If not, continue with the instructions to get your environment going. Run these again after you're done to ensure everything is working properly.

##Install Command Line Tools (Maverick)
Before this class, we suggest you upgrade your OS to Maverick. If you are running Maverick, you don't have to install Xcode in order to get command line tools.

In your terminal type `xcode-select --install` and a new window and installer will appear. 


##Xcode (Non Maverick Machines)
If you are not running Maverik, you will need to install Command Line tools that come from Xcode.


*	Create an account on Mac App Store if you haven't already.
*	Upgrade your OS to the latest version possible using the Mac App Store.
*	Open the Mac App Store and install Xcode
*	Open Xcode, Choose Preferences, Downloads and then Install The Command Line Tools

###Brew Doctor
Run `brew doctor` in your Terminal to let you know if the install was successful. It will give you tips on what you can do to correct any system wide issues. If you do have any problems, resolve them. If you have any questions or unsure, we will take care of these issues during Installfest.


You may need to edit your ~/.bashrc to have include the path to homebrew, if `brew doctor` returns any warnings.

```
bash echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:~/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```


##GIT

git config --global credential.helper cache
```

###Generate a SSH key for github

#Windows Users

Note: Using Windows is not recommened for this class.

**Ruby Installer:**

The install on Windows is actually very with the bundle from [rubyinstaller.org](http://www.rubyinstaller.org)

Just be sure to grab the 2.0.0 version, as that will be the version we will be using in class. This will set up your environment and you can start running ruby files right away. 

To install rails, run the following command `gem install ruby`


**Extra command line tools: **

We will be using the command line a lot here. On Windows I also like to install gow. Gow is a bunch of unix command line tools ported to Windows. It will make it easy to follow in class with the same commands as your Mac buddies.
